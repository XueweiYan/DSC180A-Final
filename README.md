The `run.py` file provides various modes for the tester to run:

  1. The model has been pretrained and used to predict the results, all the results are saved in the `results` folder. To directly see the testing results in seconds, please run `python run.py test`.
  2. To go through the training process once more (~10 mins), please run `python run.py model segmentation test`.
